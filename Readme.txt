This project is a website I developed during my sophomore year at university. The platform is designed for teachers in schools to create and manage teams of students. Teachers can form teams by selecting multiple students, and each team can also include multiple teachers. All teachers within the same team have collaborative access, allowing them to edit and manage all aspects related to their team seamlessly. The website promotes teamwork and efficient management by providing shared control and flexibility for educators.
